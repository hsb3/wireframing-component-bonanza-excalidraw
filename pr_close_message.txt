Closing this PR to make quality improvements before resubmission.

After initial review, I've identified several areas that need refinement:

1. **Component Visibility**: Some components (inputs, secondary buttons, cards) have insufficient contrast on white canvas. Updating border colors from Zinc-200 to Zinc-300+ for better visibility.

2. **Scale Consistency**: Device frames were at full pixel dimensions (1440x900) instead of proportionate wireframe scale. Reducing to ~1/5 size to match other components.

3. **Quality Validation**: Running comprehensive checklist to ensure all Excalidraw library guidelines are met.

I'll resubmit once these improvements are complete and thoroughly tested. Apologies for the premature submission!
